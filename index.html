In my life, I have cherished and enjoy the wonders of Ed Sheeran's songs. The man whose albums are mathematical concepts.Throughout my childhood years, I have listened to his music, witnessed him create more albums.</strong></p>

			<dd style="color: #FFFF; font-family: Sans-serif">Multiply is another album released back in 2014, when I was 4. This was the first time I listened to Ed Sheeran's songs, like Thinking Out Loud, Photograph, Tenerife Sea, and more. <dd>

				<p style="color: #28FA75; font-family: serif; text-align: center"> <strong> As for the rest of the albums, I probably wasnt born yet, nor did i have a strong connection. Although I know some songs in the other albums. But I mostly love Divide and Multiply, as I relate so much to the lyrics. It is about friendship, love, feelings for other people, understanding that life is short. Ed Sheeran's idea of naming the albums with mathematical symbols is very intersting, and I love it. </strong></p>
